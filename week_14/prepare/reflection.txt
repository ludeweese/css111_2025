#L14 Ponder: Reflection
#Lucilene DeWeese
#Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
This semester, I learned that functions are a powerful tool for organizing and simplifying code.
In my final project, the President Oaks Conference Talks Manager, I organized the program into
multiple functions for tasks like loading talks, filtering by year or keyword, sorting, displaying,
and saving results. Using functions made the program reusable, easier to read, and simpler to debug,
showing how breaking a program into smaller tasks can manage complexity. Overall, this experience 
reflected the course lesson that each function should perform a single task, which helps programs 
stay clear and maintainable.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions are valuable because they verify that each part of a program works correctly 
and catch mistakes early, making debugging faster and more efficient. In my project, I wrote tests for loading,
filtering, sorting, and saving talks, which gave me confidence that the program worked as expected. 
Writing tests also reinforced the course lessons on good coding practices, analytical thinking, 
and problem-solving, skills that will transfer to future programming courses and projects.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
When troubleshooting, I typically read error messages carefully, isolate the part of the code causing the problem,
and test smaller sections step by step. For my project, I also used test functions to ensure fixes didn’t break
other parts of the program. One thing I can improve is documenting my debugging steps more clearly,
which would make tracking solutions and avoiding repeated mistakes easier. 
This process reflects the course lessons on breaking problems into manageable pieces,
thinking analytically, and recovering from errors, which are skills I can apply in future programming 
and in other areas of study.
